# SwipeWise
> India's First Cross-Bank Reward Optimization Engine

## Overview
SwipeWise is an AI-powered credit card optimization engine that maximizes your points, miles, and cashback across all Indian banks on every single transaction. Banks design reward systems for breakage—we design them for you.

## Core Features
- **Real-Time AI Optimizer:** Evaluates merchants, merchant categories (MCC), and platform rules to recommend exactly which credit card to use at checkout, maximizing potential rewards.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Forecasting algorithms anticipate your future spending limits, optimal card usage patterns, and critical reward expirations.
- **Cross-Bank Sync:** A unified ledger that brings all your accounts and loyalty balance currencies (HDFC Bank, SBI Card, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Amex, etc.) onto a single, zero-trust security platform without compromising your banking credentials.
- **Zero-Trust Architecture:** Ensures privacy by relying on local computation or highly encrypted state variables where appropriate.
